"I will tell you a few-each one with a moral!" Sri Yukteswar's eyes twinkled with his warning. "My 
mother once tried to frighten me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I went 
there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed the ghost. Mother never 
told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you. 

"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to a neighbor. I kept my household 
in turmoil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing 
appearance. Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary halo of attractiveness to the 
object of desire. 

"A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I heard my mother remark 
occasionally: 'A man who accepts a job under anyone is a slave.' That impression became so 
indelibly fixed that even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by investing my 
family endowment in land. Moral: Good and positive suggestions should instruct the sensitive 
ears of children. Their early ideas long remain sharply etched." 

Everyone found in Master an equal courtesy and kindness. To a man who has 
realized himself as a soul, not the body or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes a striking 
similarity of aspect. The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped maya; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast an influential glance.

A yogi must be able to pass into, and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of 
multitudinous distractions never absent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of insects or the 
pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the senses must be barred. Sound and sight come 
then indeed, but to worlds fairer than the banished Eden

The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony with its countless bewildering expressions. All 
men may approach that understanding who curb the inner passion for destruction.

"All creation is governed by law," Sri Yukteswar concluded. "The ones which manifest in the outer 
universe, discoverable by scientists, are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the 
realms of consciousness which can be known only through the inner science of yoga. The hidden 
spiritual planes also have their natural and lawful principles of operation. It is not the physical 
scientist but the fully self-realized master who comprehends the true nature of matter. Thus 
Christ was able to restore the servant's ear after it had been severed by one of the disciples." 

"In shallow men the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds 
the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle."

"Wisdom is the greatest cleanser." "The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more," he said. "Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities with calmness, while trying at the same time to remove their hold. Imagination is the door through which disease as well as healing enters. Disbelieve in the reality 
of sickness even when you are ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!"

"Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady," he remarked on suitable 
occasion. "Straightforwardness without civility is like a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. 
Candor with courtesy is helpful and admirable." 

"Keen intelligence is two-edged," Master once remarked in reference to Kumar's brilliant mind. 
"It may be used constructively or destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance, or 
to decapitate one's self. Intelligence is rightly guided only after the mind has acknowledged the 
inescapability of spiritual law."

All nice discriminations are lost to the man of elemental lusts.

"Man in his waking state puts forth innumerable efforts for experiencing sensual pleasures; when the entire group 
of sensory organs is fatigued, he forgets even the pleasure on hand and goes to sleep in order to enjoy rest in the soul, his own nature," Shankara, the great Vedantist, has written. "Ultra-sensual bliss is thus extremely easy of attainment and is far superior to sense delights which always end in disgust."
